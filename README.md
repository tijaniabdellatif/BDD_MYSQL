# BDD_MYSQL
# BDD_First_Step

* In this Project, we will try to modelize a system and give it a meaning following those main steps : 

```
1 - Gathering the clients requirement.

2 - Formalize the requirements into models which facilitate the Data Analysis

3 - Implementing the data into a RMDBS like `MYSQL`
```

## First Step : 

* install `powerAMC` or `dbDesigner` to make the different type of modeling .
* Install a `MySQL server` on your computer.

*links* : 

* [MYSQL_WORKBENCH] : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/8.0.html.
* [WampServer_including_MySQL] : https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/8.0.html.
* [DBdesinger] : https://dbdesigner.fr.uptodown.com/windows.
* [powerAMC] : https://www.01net.com/telecharger/windows/Programmation/base_de_donne/fiches/telecharger-50280.html.

## Second Step : 

* Preparation of the environnement : 

```
In your Server Create a USER wich will manipulate the Database :

`*USER : yourname  *PASSWORD : 123456789`

This user will have all the privileges to manipulate the Database.

```

```
Create A Database Called : Brief_N1_N2

```


## Third Step : 

* Analyze the  requirements and the  specefications given by the clients ; execute those Tasks : 

`First` : Read the document in this folder `./Specefications`

`Second`  : In `powerAMC` Modelize the system (MCD , MLD , MPD)

`Third` : in your server create the tables and manipulate the data as will be given in `issues`.
